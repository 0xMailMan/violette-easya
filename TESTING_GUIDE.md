# 🧪 Complete System Testing Guide

This guide will help you test the complete **Violette EasyA** system: Frontend + AI Server + Blockchain Integration.

## 🎯 What You're Testing

- **Frontend**: React/Next.js UI with camera and photo upload
- **AI Processing**: Anthropic Claude analysis and embeddings
- **Blockchain**: XRPL-based DID management and Merkle tree privacy
- **Authentication**: Anonymous user sessions
- **Complete Flow**: Photo → AI Analysis → Privacy-Preserving Storage

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Testing Process

### **Step 1: Start All Required Servers**

You need to run **3 separate terminal windows/tabs**:

#### **Terminal 1: AI Server** (Port 8000)
```bash
npm run ai-server
```
Expected output: `AI Processing Server running on port 8000`

#### **Terminal 2: Backend Server** (Port 8001)
```bash
PORT=8001 npm run backend:dev
```
Expected output: `Violette Backend Server running on port 8001`

#### **Terminal 3: Frontend Server** (Port 3000)
```bash
npm run dev
```
Expected output: `Ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000`

---

### **Step 2: Run Automated Tests**

In a **4th terminal**, run the complete system test:

```bash
npm run test:complete
```

This will test:
- ✅ All servers are running
- ✅ AI analysis works
- ✅ Authentication works
- ✅ Blockchain operations work
- ✅ Merkle tree privacy features work

---

### **Step 3: Manual Frontend Testing**

1. **Open Browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

2. **Test Camera/Photo Upload**:
   - Click the camera button
   - Allow camera permissions
   - Take a photo or upload an image
   - Verify AI analysis appears

3. **Verify AI Analysis**:
   - Check that description is generated
   - Look for sentiment analysis
   - Verify themes are extracted

4. **Check Console**:
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Watch for any errors in Console
   - Verify API calls are successful

---

## 🔍 Advanced Testing Scenarios

### **Test 1: Photo Analysis Flow**
1. Upload a sunset photo
2. Verify AI generates poetic description
3. Check sentiment is positive
4. Confirm themes include "nature", "photography"

### **Test 2: Different Content Types**
- Try photos of: food, people, landscapes, objects
- Test text-only entries
- Verify consistent AI analysis quality

### **Test 3: Privacy Features**
- Check that sensitive info is removed
- Verify anonymized user IDs
- Test Merkle tree proof generation

### **Test 4: Blockchain Integration**
- Verify XRPL testnet connection
- Test DID creation (requires proper auth)
- Confirm Merkle root storage

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

#### **Port Already in Use**
```bash
# Kill existing processes
pkill -f "ai-server"
pkill -f "nodemon" 
pkill -f "next"

# Restart in correct order
```

#### **Firebase Errors**
- Check `.env` file has correct `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`
- Verify `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` matches your project

#### **AI Server Issues**
- Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
- Check API quota/billing status

#### **Blockchain Connection Issues**
- XRPL testnet might be temporarily down
- Network issues can affect XRPL connectivity
